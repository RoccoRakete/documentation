# Homarr 1.0 - complete rewrite of all systems
We proudly present to you - Homarr ``1.0``.
We have started work on this new version back in 2023 and have worked tirelessly for months on this brand-new dashboard.

This isn't our usual update. ``1.0`` doesn't use the same code from previous versions, but has been written from the ground up.
Therefore, this version contains an unusual amount of breaking changes.
This will be a one time occurrence and version > ``1.0`` will have less breaking changes.
This time more important than every; **read the breaking changes** list and **create a backup** before updating.
Some third party installation methods may take multiple days or weeks to update to the new version.

## Changes at a glance
- **Asynchronous integrations system**: In versions prior to ``1.0``, we fetched data upon each request synchronously.
This means that the user had to wait for the requests to finish so any data would appear.
A page reload will trigger another request - and worse, this will happen for every user accessing your dashboard.
In ``1.0``, we have implemented a new system that gets rid of this system and scales linearly.
It will fetch data in background, even if you are not on the page.
- **Permissions system**: You can now use detailed permissions to allow or prohibit users from certain actions.
For easier management, you can organize users into groups and manage them all at the same time.
- **Integration testing**: Starting from ``1.0``, we will require you to test the integration before you can use it.
This guarantees that you've configured your integration correctly and helps you find errors faster.
- **Re-imagined widgets**: All widgets have been rewritten & improved. They offer much better performance,
reliability and scalability compared to < ``1.0``.
- **Improved performance**: We have upgraded the underlying framework of Homarr and take advantage
of an in-memory message bus and websockets to deliver data near realtime to you.

## Breaking changes
:::warning

Please consult the breaking changes list & upgrade guide if you used third-party installation methods.

:::

- Docker Image
  - Removed support for ``arm/v7`` -> upgrade to newer architectures as an alternative
  - Renamed image from ``ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr`` to ``ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr``. We now use semantic versioning for our release numbers.
- Environment Variables
  - Removed ``DISABLE_ANALYTICS``, can now be configured via UI
  - Renamed ``AUTH_PROVIDER`` to ``AUTH_PROVIDERS``
  - Changed default value of ``PORT`` from ``7575`` to ``3000``
  - Renamed ``DATABASE_URL`` to ``DB_URL`` and made it optional conditionally. If ``DB_HOST`` is set, this is optional - otherwise it's required.
  - Added ``DB_DRIVER`` with values ``better-sqlite3`` (default) or ``mysql2``.
  - Added other database configuration environment variables: ``DB_HOST``, ``DB_PORT``, ``DB_USER``, ``DB_PASSWORD``, ``DB_NAME`` (consult documentation for detailed information on these)
  - Changed ``DOCKER_HOST`` from a single string to a comma seperated string list
  - ``AUTH_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`` must now be a valid Url
  - Increased minimum length of ``AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`` to 1
  - Increased minimum length of ``AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`` to 1
  - Removed ``AUTH_OIDC_TIMEOUT`` **<ins># TODO: Discuss whether we need to copy this?</ins>**
  - Removed ``AUTH_OIDC_AUTO_LOGIN`` **<ins># TODO: Discuss whether we need to copy this?</ins>**
  - Removed ``AUTH_LDAP_ADMIN_GROUP`` and ``AUTH_LDAP_OWNER_GROUP`` -> groups are now managed without manual env binding
  - ``CI`` will now also trigger an env validation skip like ``SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION``
- Mounts
  - Removed ``/app/data/configs`` -> JSON configs have been removed in favour of relation databases
  - Changed ``/app/public/icons`` to ``/images`` **<ins># TODO: Do we want this path? Is the local source already working?</ins>**
  - Moved ``/data`` to ``/appdata`` and restructured contents (not backwards compatible!) -> Create a backup before migration of the entire directory to copy data to new Homarr
- Database:
  - Changed schema of the database to a completely new schema. They are not backwards compatible. Please export the data from old Homarr in the UI and import it in ``1.0``
  - Removed all usage of JSON files to store data. Import JSON files in Homarr ``1.0`` to import your dashboards.
  - Removed ``schemaVersion`` from JSON and use the drizzle migrations to keep track of schema versions and take care of migrations.
- Web Server:
  - Added an internal Nginx proxy to forward requests to two servers inside the container for technical reasons.
  This could impact edge cases with iframes, cookies and custom setups.
- Dependencies
  - We now depend on [Redis](https://redis.io/) as a real time messaging bus
- Development (relevant for contributors):
  - Migrated to [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
  - Migrated to a mono-repository
  - All source code has been migrated to the [homarr-labs GitHub organization](https://github.com/homarr-labs)
- Platform specific breaking changes:
  - TrueNAS
    - The TrueCharts app chart is permanently deprecated and no longer maintained / supported. Please migrate to Electric Eel or a different Kubernetes platform.
  - Unraid
    - The Homarr app must be reinstalled. The existing directories on your disk are not compatible with Homarr 1.0. Export your old data in < `` 1.0`` and install using different file system locations.
  - Kubernetes
    - The official Helm chart has moved from https://github.com/oben01/charts to https://github.com/homarr-labs/charts
